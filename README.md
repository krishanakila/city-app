üìå Viewing Note:
The project is designed mobile-first. You can preview it directly from your desktop browser and I‚Äôve set a max-width(375px) constraint to simulate mobile layout even on larger screens. It‚Äôs also responsive and works well on real mobile devices if you prefer testing that way.

- React 19 + TypeScript

- Tailwind CSS 4 (mobile-first design)

- React Router DOM
